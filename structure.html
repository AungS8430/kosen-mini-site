                    The KOSEN-KMITL program is a unique 5-year integrated
                    educational system that combines high school and
                    undergraduate engineering education. This Japanese-style
                    "Kosen" (College of Technology) model focuses on practical,
                    hands-on engineering skills from an early age.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Students enter the program after completing junior high
                    school (Grade 9) and graduate with an Associate Degree in
                    Engineering after 5 years of intensive study. The curriculum
                    emphasizes:
